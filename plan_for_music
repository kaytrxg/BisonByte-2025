music: 
-- would be thinking about certain problem through music apps that we didn't think about
-- story: creating the artist and environment for creative flow
    -- music is a platform for cultural change; would break the barriaer and create the platform that would give the user/artist to create unique beats

-- admiring to the past artist creating music/ creatgive freedom; 
    -- would give the description of instrument being used, time tables, time it was produced, the history behind ti for potential inspiration


STEPS TO DO: 
-- grabbing and storing the beat AI gives us
    understand the background, is there one already made? 
-- ways of how speaking could be interpretted (wavelengths changing on an off) 
-- grabbing the beat and being able to prompt the beats name and by artist through social media 
    the legal standpoint to where it would be a sample anymore since it's unqiue enough
    knowing other platforms would pay, while the one we create is free
-- create a story for teh music platform


-- would have a certain prompt to choose the beats <-- guideline for the data being entered
-- different insturment that could come about through humming into a mic
    - being able to hum a beat
