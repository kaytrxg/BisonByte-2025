music: 
-- would be thinking about certain problem through music apps that we didn't think about
-- story: creating the artist and environment for creative flow
    -- music is a platform for cultural change; would break the barriaer and create the platform that would give the user/artist to create unique beats

-- admiring to the past artist creating music/ creative freedom; 
    -- would give the description of instrument being used, time tables, time it was produced, the history behind ti for potential inspiration


STEPS TO DO: 
-- grabbing and storing the beat AI gives us
    understand the background, is there one already made? 
-- ways of how speaking could be interpretted (wavelengths changing on an off) 
-- grabbing the beat and being able to prompt the beats name and by artist through social media 
    the legal standpoint to where it would be a sample anymore since it's unqiue enough
    knowing other platforms would pay, while the one we create is free
-- create a story for the music platform

Adding a fun component: 
-- AI gives a random beat generated, beats generated by ppl on the app
    -- the beat would be customized when the person creates their own beat
-- singing battle; where the people can create verses on top of the randomly generated beat
-- get the votes, and vote would increase the players points overtime, 
-- the two best could compete against each other, and whoever wins can get the beat for free
