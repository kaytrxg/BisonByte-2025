Accountability bodies (matching people based off culture practices. If someone from an African country that has a high spce diet can match with someone from an Asian country that both have risk for ulcers and GERD)
AI tracks symptoms and vital signs and helps them match with potential diseases they might be having and they can go over them with their doctor in their next appointment
Allows them to make schedules with their doctor
Collects information from their fitbit, apple watch, smartphone, etc. 
Allows them manually input information their tracker can't record (e.g. weight, SpO2, etc.)

## Inspiration: A lot of patients have rebounds in the hospital due to their chronic conditions because they don't keep up to date with their vital sign and symptom progressions, dificulty keeping up with their health or diffiulty reaching their healthcare provider. Medilink allows patients to stay up to date with their vital signs, get reminders to monitor manual input symptoms and vital signs, methods to help alleviate their symptoms and bring their vital signs back to their notmal ranges,etc. All while providing them a community to annonymously reach out to other annonymous patients on the platform with similar symptoms and backgrounds. On the provider's end, it allows providers to instantaneously get notified of their patient's distress signals, extreme discrepancies in their patient's vitals, scheduling appointments, etc. 

## What it does: It allows patient's link their wearables (e.g. apple watches, fitbit, etc.) to their portal which iis also linked to their providers profile, allowing their proivder to have access to their at home daily vitals, recent distress signals, etc.
Patient's can send messages to their provider preceeding their next checkup allowing the provider to have accurate and immediate records of their symptoms. Patients can link up with other patients with the same conditions or symptoms as them and similar backgrounds so they can have anonymous accountability partners
